## What You Get?

>Awesome Natural Wines

We only put wines that we personally love in the club. Most of the winemakers are small, artisan winemakers making less than 10,000 cases/year. You'll see a nice mix of popular producers that we all know and love, as well as some  hidden gems that we're sure you've never tried before!

>Personal Touches

Every wine we put in the club comes with custom information on the producer, notes on the wine, serving suggestions, and (our favorite part) food pairing suggestions.

>The Best Customer Service

As a two-person team, we started this company to make natural wine more affordable, approachable, and fun for regular people like us. We read and respond to every message we get. If you have questions, didn’t like a bottle, or just want to chat, we’re here to make this the best experience you’ve ever had in wine!
